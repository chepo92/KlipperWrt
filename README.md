# KlipperWrt
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A guide to get _**Klipper**_ with _**fluidd**,_ _**Mainsail**_ or _**Duet-Web-Control**_ on OpenWrt embeded devices like the _Creality Wi-Fi Box_. Or (almost) any device that can run [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org)

> **Note**
> The old readme.md contains outdated information, so it has been moved off the main page. it can still be accessed [here](README.old.md).

The original [KlipperWRT](https://github.com/ihrapsa/KlipperWrt), while great, is not perfect. There is outdated information, unclear instructions, and a bunch of other things - such as no real support for any device other than the Creality Wi-Fi Box. KlipperWRT-EX intends to fix that.

KlipperWRT-EX revolves around a few core principles:
- UCI integration
- Reproducibility
- Simplicity
- Safety
More information on what this entails can be found [here](Docs/Principles.md)

*Keep in mind that this is a personal project, and I won't have time to do everything - but I hope I can at least clear a bit of the confusion and help people along in the right direction.*
